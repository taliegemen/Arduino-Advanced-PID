# Arduino-Advanced-PID
An advanced PID that uses Series and Ideal algorithm, which can be tuned theoretically unlike Parallel algorithm
To use you need a DC motor and Encoder library, optitionally you can get PLX-DAQ to note various data from Arduino.

Atmega328 microcontroller is programmed as a PID controller. Moreover, a brief information about ideal and conventional PID algorithms, tuning parameters, hardware and software of the system that is used is given.},  keywords={brushless DC motors;microcontrollers;three-term control;microcontroller unit;proportional integral derivative parameters;Ziegler-Nichols;Cohen-Coon;squared error;absolute error;PID controller;PID tuning methods;brushless DC motor;Atmega328 microcontroller;L298N circuit;Tuning;Software algorithms;Software;PD control;PI control;Hardware;Control engineering;PID algorithm;Parameter Tuning;BLDC},  doi={10.1109/CEIT.2018.8751768},  ISSN={},  month={Oct},}
